# Project Rules

## Code Protection
- Files marked with "// FINALISED" at the top should NOT be modified
- Before editing any file, state which file you're editing and why
- Only edit the specific section requested — don't refactor surrounding code
- If a previous edit is working, don't touch it when working on something else
- Moving one segment or anything can potentially move others. Make sure this is kept in mind, and you are aware of what is being impacted by your code. 

## Workflow
- When asked to fix/add something, ONLY touch the relevant code
- Don't "improve" or "clean up" code that wasn't mentioned
- If you need to modify finalised code, ASK FIRST
